create alarm application to take in a playlist that'll shuffle through the songs so that everyday user can wake up to a different song.

OPTIONAL:
check for the most replayed section of the song and have the alarm start at that section.


To add:
	when app is downloaded, create a folder to store the songs and user can then go there to add or delete, or can use the GUI in the app to also do the same.

	sound of the app gradually gets louder and louder

	(optional) have the app control system sound so that it will be playing louder
